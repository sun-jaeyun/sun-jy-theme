## Why?

I love the Community Material Theme (also known as the legacy version of Material Theme), especially the Darker High Contrast variant. However, starting December 2023, the official legacy version is no longer available on the marketplace. Unfortunately, the Darker High Contrast from the new official Material Theme doesn’t meet my preferences.

As a result, I decided to fork the theme from the legacy version to continue using the one I love.
